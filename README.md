# AVATAR area visualizer

It's a visualizer for [DIKU](https://dikumud.com/) based area files, but only tested on the dialect used by [AVATAR](https://www.outland.org).

By default, groups rooms into "floors" separated by up/down connections. It won't lay out rooms perfectly, so expect to do some manual rearrangement by clicking and dragging rooms.

* Double-click a room to seelect all rooms on the same "floor".
* Ctrl-click to select multiple rooms at once.
* Right-click to undo a drag in progress.
